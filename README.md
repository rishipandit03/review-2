README.md for Doctor Appointment System Project


# Doctor Appointment System

The **Doctor Appointment System** is a web-based platform that allows patients to register, log in, view their profile, and book appointments with doctors. This project is built using **Java**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Bootstrap** for a responsive and interactive interface.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Register, login, and manage user profiles.
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Patients can schedule appointments with doctors.
- **Profile Management**: Users can view and update their personal information.
- **Validation**: Client-side validation for forms such as email, password strength, and required fields.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive pages optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
- **Backend**: Java (for handling server-side logic and database interactions)
- **Database**: (Optional: specify your database, e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- **Framework**: (If applicable, e.g., Spring Boot for Java)

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up the Doctor Appointment System on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

- **Java**: Ensure Java is installed on your machine. You can download it from [Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
- **Maven**: If you're using Maven for Java project management, ensure it's installed. You can download Maven from [here](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
- **IDE**: A development environment like **IntelliJ IDEA**, **Eclipse**, or **NetBeans**.
- **Database**: (Optional) Install and configure a database such as **MySQL** or **PostgreSQL** for managing appointments and user data.

### Steps to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/doctor-appointment-system.git
   cd doctor-appointment-system
Backend (Java) Setup:

If you're using Maven, make sure to run the following command to install dependencies:
bash
mvn install
Database Configuration:

Set up the database schema and tables. Example SQL commands can be found in the database/ folder (if included).
Modify the database connection settings in your Java code (e.g., in application.properties if using Spring Boot).
Run the Application:

Use your preferred IDE to run the Java backend application. If you are using Spring Boot, run the Application.java class to start the backend server.
Frontend:

The frontend is contained in the src/main/resources/static/ folder (or a similar folder for static assets).
The frontend uses Bootstrap and custom CSS for a responsive UI. Simply open the HTML files in a browser to view and interact with the system.

Form Validation
The system implements client-side validation for form inputs such as:

Email: Validates proper email format (e.g., user@example.com).
Password Strength: Ensures the password meets the required length and includes a mix of characters.
Required Fields: Checks that no field is left empty before form submission.
Dynamic Feedback: Provides error messages near form fields for better user interaction.
